Run>> error>> as no view for Index()action method in Views Folder. Index.csHtml has to be there in Views Folder
views has to be there in Views folder with the names of Action methods of controllers classes.
HomeController.cs has Index() action method -- hence Index.cshtml file should be there in Views Folder inside a folder 
with Controller class file name -- Index.cshtml in Hom folder in Views folder -- here no Index.cshtml

for timebeing, in HomeController.cs classfile changed the return type ActionResult to String and returend a Stirng "Hello MVC 5 Application".. Run

Now change the URL to http://localhost:xxxx/Home/Index

In the URL “Home” is the name of the controller and “Index” is the name of the action method within the HomeController class.

the mapping is defined within the RegisterRoutes() method of the RouteConfig class which is in App_Start
In RegisterRoutes() method of RouteConfig.cs class id is optional so http://localhost:xxxx/Home/Index 
OR http://localhost:xxxx/Home/Index/10 will work.
